This project is developed by Elliott Chang, Cameron Adams, and Zoe Drajem to explore the relationship between multiple variables relating to location, specific job, specific field, etc and salary. We hope to provide useful insight for emerging data scientists/statisticians on which factors most significantly impact their future salaries.

## Introduction

## 



## Rubric

* Roughly I recommend 1 slide for introduction, 2 slides for Question 1, ans 2 slides for Question 2. 
  + You can imagine spending roughly one minute on each slide.
  + You should feel free to have more (or fewer) slides. 
  
* Your evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer). We donâ€™t care how many slides you use to do this.

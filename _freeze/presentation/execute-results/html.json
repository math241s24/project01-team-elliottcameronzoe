We are all interested in careers in data science and we want be knowledgeable about the field as we prepare for graduation.\n\nOur data:\n\n-   Variables: salary (in local currency), salary (in USD), job title, job category, country of origin, company location (country), work year, work experience, age, work setting, company size, and employment type\n-   Observations represent individual employees in a given year (2020-2023)\n-   9355 rows, 12 columns\n-   Source: https://ai-jobs.net/salaries/2023/\n\n\nQ1: How do company-related factors (like job title, job category,work setting, and company size) influence the salary of workers in the field of data science?\n\nQ2: How do personal factors (like location, experience level, and employment type) influence the salary of workers in the field of data science?\n\n## Question 1\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 1\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 2\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Rubric\n\n-   Roughly I recommend 1 slide for introduction, 2 slides for Question 1, ans 2 slides for Question 2.\n    -   You can imagine spending roughly one minute on each slide.\n    -   You should feel free to have more (or fewer) slides.\n-   Your evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer). We don't care how many slides you use to do this.\n",

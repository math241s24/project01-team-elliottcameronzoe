For each plot, provide a clear explanation as to why this plot (e.g. boxplot, barplot, histogram, etc.) is best for providing the information you are asking about. The two plots should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.\n\n\n\nIn this section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides. You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not required to do so. All plots must be made with ggplot2. Do not use base R or lattice plotting functions.\n\n\n\nIn the Discussion section, interpret the results of your analysis. Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\n\n\n\n\nSame structure outlined for Question 1, but for your new question. And the title should relate to the question you’re answering.\nWe encourage you to be concise. A paragraph should typically not be longer than 5 sentences.\nYou are not required to perform any statistical tests in this project, but you may do so if you find it helpful to answer your question."
